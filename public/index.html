            <h3 class="intro">Cleaning Up Our Closets, For Good</h3>
            <p>Our closets harvest an ecosystem of their own. In a day when we learn more about carbon footprints and product lifecycles, most of our closets remain in the dark. There's hardly time in a day to enlighten them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But there are plenty of steps to take.
            <a href="signup.html" class="btn btn-padded frontpage-btn" id="start" type="button">New to the Site? Start Here</a>
            <br>
            <p>Closets For Good wants to be your tool, in realizing and maintaining the wardrobe you're after. You might need more space. You might need more savings. You might buy for a household, and you need more sanity. You might need more variety, or the opposite: simplicity. You might need to migrate styles. Along the way, we help you confirm that your donations apply to goodwill causes. We provide alternatives to cumbersome habits and storage nightmares, in an overall time when the developed world purchases roughly 5 times as much clothing than in 1980 and throws away over 40% more textiles than we did just 15 years ago.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Learn the tenets of slower fashion, receive discounts from quality retailers, get a map to your ideal wardrobe, and devise a routine system.</p>
            <br>
            <div id="midImage">
              <button class="btn btn-padded frontpage-btn" type="button"><a href="resources.html">Learn about setting a Target Wardrobe</a></button>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Once you attain your ideal wardrobe profile, you maintain that system by marking donations in your account and receiving discounted suggestions from retail partners. These suggestions line up with your preferences and incorporate methods for truly Reducing, Reusing and Recycling among textile categories. Whenever you replenish outside the C4G retail network, simply update your account wardrobe to reflect it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There's no ultimate answer for managing all of our clothes consumption. Closets For Good helps manage that. An estimated 85% of textiles in the developed world are not even recycled. Donating may be a costly route to a recycling center, while second-hand sales gone abroad can undermine the generativity of local economies. It can be tough to know where your donated goods will land, but you can save millions of charity dollars by learning when and where to recycle a textile directly, and we are glad to tell you more about any sorter operations you select through Closets For Good. </p>
